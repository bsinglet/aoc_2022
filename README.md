# aoc_2022
My solutions for Advent of Code 2022, all written in Rust. 

See https://adventofcode.com/2022/ for more information on the competition itself.

## Days
01. [day01.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day01.rs) - There's not much to say here. It's a simple case of reading a text file, converting strings to integers, and performing basic arithmetic. The unit tests verify the examples given in the problem description.
02. [day02.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day02.rs) -  This was a fun [challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) based around Rock Paper Scissors. My first solution spelled out each permutation, but my [revamped solution](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day02_alt_solution.rs) used a more elegant solution.
03. [day03.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day03.rs) - Another beginner-level challenge. Rust's [HashSets](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) made quick work of this.
04. [day04.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day04.rs) - This was a very easy challenge, but I initially misunderstood Part 2 here and solved a much more difficult task than it was describing! I left the harder solution in a comment block in the code. 
05. [day05.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day05.rs)
06. [day06.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day06.rs)
07. [day07.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day07.rs)
08. [day08.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day08.rs)
09. [day09.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day09.rs)
10. [day10.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day10.rs)
11. [day11.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day11.rs)
12. [day12.rs](https://github.com/bsinglet/aoc_2022/blob/master/src/day12.rs)
